one way is to calculate next smaller element and prev smaller element separately using 2 passes.
otherwise, when calculating prev smaller element, for element i when you pop the greater elements on stack, for the element on top of stack the next smaller element is the element i and the prev smaller element is the next element on the stack so we can calculate the area for each bar in one pass.

after traversing over the whole array we will still have some elements left so to calculate area for those we will traverse till i=n
